### 1. **Login_Profile:**
   - **Description**: A component where users input a username and data, which is displayed on a profile page after login. It demonstrates basic form handling and data persistence.
   - **Context API Use**: Store `user` data in context after login, access it across components, and provide a method to update or reset the data.
     
### 2. **Simple User Authentication**
   - **Description**: Create a basic login system where you can store the user's authentication state (logged in or not) in the global context. Manage the user's login/logout functionality and protect certain routes based on the authentication status.
   - **Context API Use**: Store `isAuthenticated` and `user` in the context, and provide functions like `login()` and `logout()` to update the state.

### 3. **Theme Switcher App**
   - **Description**: Build an app where users can toggle between light and dark themes. Use the Context API to manage the theme state and apply the appropriate styles based on the user's selection.
   - **Context API Use**: Store the current theme (`light` or `dark`) in the context and provide a method to toggle it.

### 4. **Shopping Cart**
   - **Description**: Develop a simple shopping cart where you can add, remove, and update products. Use the Context API to store the cart state and manage product actions (like quantity updates).
   - **Context API Use**: Store the `cart` state globally, with functions to `addToCart()`, `removeFromCart()`, and `clearCart()`.

### 5. **Language Selector**
   - **Description**: Create an app where users can switch between different languages (e.g., English, French, Spanish). The app should update its text content dynamically based on the selected language.
   - **Context API Use**: Store the selected language in the context and provide a method to change it.

### 6. **Note Taking App**
   - **Description**: Build a simple note-taking app where users can add, edit, and delete notes. Use Context API to manage the state of all notes and synchronize changes globally.
   - **Context API Use**: Store the `notes` state in the context and provide functions for `addNote()`, `editNote()`, and `deleteNote()`.

### 7. **To-Do List with Multiple Filters**
   - **Description**: Create a to-do list app with the ability to filter tasks by "all," "completed," or "pending." Use the Context API to store the tasks and filter them based on the user's selection.
   - **Context API Use**: Manage the list of tasks and the current filter (`all`, `completed`, `pending`) in the context.

### 8. **Product List with Sorting**
   - **Description**: Display a list of products that users can sort by price or rating. The sorting preference should be global, so all product displays reflect the user's choice.
   - **Context API Use**: Store the sorting preference (e.g., `sortBy: 'price'` or `sortBy: 'rating'`) in the context and apply it to the product display.

These projects will help you get hands-on experience with React Context API and understand how to manage global state effectively!
